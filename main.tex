%% This is a template for the final papers of the Project Module in the MAI program of the THWS.
%% The template is a minor modification of the SCORES conference template (https://www.scores.si/).
%% I hereby thank the original authors Klemen Berkovi\v{c}, Iztok Fister Jr., Iztok Fister and Luka F\"{u}rst
%% Any errors or problems in this template are my own doing. 
%% The template uses the acmart package https://ctan.org/pkg/acmart?lang=en

%% The first command in your LaTeX source must be the \documentclass command.
%% We use the review anonymous format for submissions - do not change this!
\documentclass[sigconf, review, nonacm, anonymous]{acmart}
% \documentclass[sigconf, nonacm]{acmart}

%% \BibTeX command to typeset BibTeX logo in the docs
\AtBeginDocument{\providecommand\BibTeX{{Bib\TeX}}}

%% Hack to allow for comments about author contribution - not used
% \newcommand{\projectcontrib}[1]{\affiliation{\country{#1}}}

%% If you need any other LaTeX packages, add them here
\usepackage{verbatim}
\usepackage{todonotes}
\usepackage[linesnumbered, boxed, resetcount]{algorithm2e}

%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style, or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include support for advanced citation of software artefact from thebiblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.

%% print page numbers
\settopmatter{printfolios=true} 

%% end of the preamble, start of the body of the document source.
\begin{document}

%% The "title" command has an optional parameter allowing the author to define a "short title" to be used in page headers.
\title[A Deep Learning Approach to 3D Human Walking Pose Estimation From SensFloor Capacitive Signals]{A Deep Learning Approach to 3D Human Walking Pose Estimation From SensFloor Capacitive Signals}

%% The "author" command is used to define the authors.
%% You shall submit the anonymised version of your paper for review, so no need to include author names here.
% \author{First Awsomeauthor}
% \affiliation{\institution{THWS, MAI}\city{}\country{}}

% \author{Second Greatauthor}
% \affiliation{\institution{THWS, MAI}\city{}\country{}}

% \author{Third Amazingauthor}

\begin{abstract}
\input{sections/00-abstract.tex}
\end{abstract}

%% Keywords: pick words that accurately describe the work being presented. Separate the keywords with commas - not used.
\keywords{SensFloor, Human pose estimation, Deep Learning, LSTM, Kalman Filter, Capacitive Floor, MediaPipe}
%% This command processes the author and affiliation and title information and builds the first part of the formatted document.
