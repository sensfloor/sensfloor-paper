% General overview of how to solve the problem (localization and pose prediction)

% Data collection (important: mention how our data looks like)
% - Who did we collect?
% - How does the recording setup look like?
% - Collect video and sensfloor at the same time -> Output: mp4 and csv
% - Creating labels for training using Mediapipe -> Output: Ground truth joint positions in coordinate system with hip as origin

% Describe training of the model
% - Model architecture: Supervised regression model
% - Data split
% - Loss (link loss, MSE)
% - Metrics (PCK, MJPE)
% - Training setup (config) and how we determined the hyperparameters -> Mention what joints we predict here (or in data collection)
% - What is the output?

% Describe localization
% - Sensor & clustering of signals
% - Kalman filter approach
% - Component values
% - What is the output?

% Describe how localization and pose prediction are combined -> Summary that connects training and localization outputs

% How to visualize floor and predicted pose
% - Setup for live predictions
