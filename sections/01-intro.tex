\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Human pose estimation is a fundamental task in various domains, like healthcare, rehabilitation, and gait analysis \cite{avogaro2023markerlesshumanpose}. To this end, camera-based systems are a widely adopted approach due to their ease of setup and efficiency. However, the performance of such systems is highly dependent on camera placement and the field of view, making them susceptible to occlusion. Furthermore, continuous video monitoring raises significant privacy concerns, especially in sensitive environments such as elderly care, where pose monitoring could support caregivers. Consequently, alternative, privacy-preserving sensing approaches are required. Considering these issues, one promising alternative for estimating human poses is floor-based sensing technology. Generally, there are two ways to measure activity using floors: pressure- and capacitance-based. In this study, we examine SensFloor, developed by Future-Shape GmbH, as an example of a ca\-pa\-ci\-tance-based floor. As it is easy to install, SensFloor can be used in various domains, like healthcare, safety monitoring and retail analytics. It is composed of multiple rectangular sensing areas, hereafter referred to as patches. Each patch consists of eight triangular sensors, referred to as fields. Each field registers changes in capacitance and outputs a signal between 127 and 255 sampled at 10~Hz. The signal's intensity depends on the magnitude of the detected change. Since the human body contains mostly water, walking over the floor alters the capacitance, which SensFloor uses to detect human movement \cite[71]{lauterbach2013largeareasensorsystema}.

SensFloor has been used in several prior studies. It has been leveraged to estimate age from walking behavior, identify individuals based on characteristic movement patterns and recognize gait patterns \cite{hoffmann2018estimatingpersonsage,sousa2013humantrackingidentification,hoffmann2021detectingwalkingchallenges}. While these studies demonstrate the capability of SensFloor for tracking and behavioral analysis, they primarily address 2D localization or classification tasks rather than pose estimation. For the task of human pose estimation, different studies examined pressure-based sensors integrated in floor coverings or shoe insoles using deep-learning techniques \cite{luo2021intelligentcarpetinferring, watanabe2025p2pinsolehumanpose}. However, the feasibility of estimating full-body 3D walking poses from capacitive signals remains largely unexplored.

This study aims to determine whether 3D human walking poses can be estimated solely from SensFloor signals and to evaluate the estimation accuracy. For this purpose, we created a labeled dataset, trained a neural network to estimate poses, extracted the subjects' position from the floor, smoothed the trajectory using a Kalman filter and implemented a frontend for visualization.
