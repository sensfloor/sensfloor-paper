This paper is a sample \LaTeX\ document to be reused by students of the Master's in Artificial Intelligence of the THWS in preparing their final papers for the Project Module.
The document covers the commonly employed parts and elements of a scientific paper and instructions how to correctly include them.
There are, however, many more features in the \LaTeX\ typesetting system than can be used when writing a paper and students are expected to explore these on their own and employ these as appropriate.
